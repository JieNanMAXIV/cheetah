Follow these step to get started with psana Cheetah

1) sit_setup: 
Type "sit_setup" every time you change into this directory for compiling.
If you are not up to date with latest version of ana, type "sit_setup ana-current"

2) scons: 
Type "scons" in ~/analysis-rel/ directory. This compiles all packages in 
the subdirectories, 
1) XTC proof reader and 
2) Cheetah

3) psana.cfg: 
Select the module you want to run

4) myPsana: 
This executes psana on the specified XTC
For multiple XTC files, use "\"

library libcheetah_ana_pkg.so: libcheetah.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No 
such file or directory [in function loadPackageLib at psana/src/DynLoader.cpp:158]

Solution:

Type this in your terminal
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/reg/neh/home/yoon82/cheetah/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

2) If you get the following message -
