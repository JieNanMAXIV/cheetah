This is an example analysis pipeline that might be useful
when beginning an analysis session for a particular 
experiment.

You will want to copy the contents of this directory to some
place and modify scripts as needed.

1. If you haven't run the cheetah before, you will first have to
configure proper input files:
- Go to the config directory and modify the script environ
There are some scripts called "setup.bash" that may be handy.  
- Go to config/mask and generate some masks
- Go to config/geom and generate a reasonable cheetah geometry file
- Go to config/ini/example and generate some cheetah config files

2. Once you've obtained the proper input files, you can test run the
cheetah on an experiment:
- Go to hitfinder and try running run-cheetah-psana
You have to modify the paths in run-cheetah-psana prior to execution.
The ini files in the hitfinder directory are sample config files for
the experiment cxi64813. You have to modify or replace them with proper
config files for your experiment.

Sorry, but you may also need to install a bunch of dependencies, e.g.
- python with h5py
- crystfel
- make_pixelmap
Or, use someone else's compiled programs.
