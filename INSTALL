To build cheetah you need cmake (and optionally ccmake). 

If you're on psexport you can just do:
export PATH=~filipe/cmake/bin:${PATH}

Otherwise just ask your sysadmin to install it, or download the
precompiled package:
wget http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.10.2-Linux-i386.tar.gz

Now that you have cmake we can start the build:

- Create and go into a build directory:
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

- Run ccmake
$ ccmake ..

- Press "c" to configure. 

- It's possible that you have to specify ANA_RELEASE manually. It should
point to the ana-current directory, for example on psexport it is 
/reg/g/psdm/sw/releases/ana-current/

- You can also specify the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. I set mine to ~/usr
- If everything went well you should be able to
press "g" to generate the Makefiles.

- Now just run make. This will build things and place the result in the
build directory.
$ make


- If you want to install just do.
$ make install
