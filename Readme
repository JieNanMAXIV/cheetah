There are a couple of steps to follow when starting from scratch:

1. Compile libcheetah (the analysis part of the code)
2. Link libcheetah to the file reading front-end (currently psana at LCLS)
3. Set up environment configuration (where are the programs, where is the data?)
4. Run the analysis script
